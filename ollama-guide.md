# Ollama guide

### What it is and why we will use it
Ollama is an amazing tool that abstracts the complexity to interact with LLMs.

### Why we will use it
In this case we will use it to:
 - Download LLMs to our localhost,
 - Interact with local LLMs via terminal,
 - Use the ollama automatically created local API to make an HTTP request.
